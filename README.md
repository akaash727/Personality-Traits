 What is a Big Five factor Model?
A Review of Literature
         In psychology, five broad dimensions (the ‘Big Five’) are commonly used in the research and study of
personality.
         Since the late 20th Century, these factors have been used to measure, and develop a better understanding
of, individual differences in personality.The five factors may be easily remembered using the acronym ‘OCEAN’.
Raymond Cattell developed a 16-item inventory of personality traits and created the Sixteen Personality Factor
Questionnaire (16PF) instrument to measure these traits.
                               Robert McCrae and Paul Costa later developed the Five-Factor Model, or FFM, which describes
personality in terms of five broad factors
